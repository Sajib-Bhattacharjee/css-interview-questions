## Basic CSS Questions ‚ú®

1. **What is CSS?**

   - **Solution:** CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is used to style and layout web pages ‚Äî for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

2. **How do you include CSS in a webpage?**

   - **Solution:** CSS can be included in a webpage in three ways:
     - ‚û°Ô∏è Inline: Using the `style` attribute inside HTML elements.
     - ‚û°Ô∏è Internal: Using the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section.
     - ‚û°Ô∏è External: Using the `<link>` tag to link an external CSS file.

3. **What is the difference between `margin` and `padding`?**

   - **Solution:** `margin` is the space outside the border of an element, while `padding` is the space inside the border of an element.

4. **What is the box model in CSS?**

   - **Solution:** The CSS box model is a rectangular layout paradigm for HTML elements that consists of the following: content, padding, border, and margin.

5. **What is the difference between `display: none` and `visibility: hidden`?**

   - **Solution:** `display: none` removes the element from the document flow, and it will not take up any space. `visibility: hidden` hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.

6. **What is the purpose of the `z-index` property?**

   - **Solution:** The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with a higher `z-index` will be displayed in front of an element with a lower `z-index`.

7. **What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?**

   - **Solution:** `em` is relative to the font-size of its closest or current element, while `rem` is relative to the font-size of the root element (`<html>`).

8. **What is the `float` property used for?**

   - **Solution:** The `float` property is used to push an element to the left or right, allowing other elements to wrap around it.

9. **What is the difference between `id` and `class` in CSS?**

   - **Solution:** An `id` is unique and can be used to identify a single element, while a `class` can be used to identify multiple elements.

10. **What is the `!important` rule in CSS?**
    - **Solution:** The `!important` rule is used to override other styling rules for a specific property. It should be used sparingly as it can make debugging difficult.

## CSS Selectors üéØ

11. **What is a CSS selector?**

    - **Solution:** A CSS selector is a pattern used to select the element(s) you want to style.

12. **What is the difference between `#id` and `.class` selectors?**

    - **Solution:** `#id` selects an element with a specific `id` attribute, while `.class` selects elements with a specific `class` attribute.

13. **What is the universal selector in CSS?**

    - **Solution:** The universal selector (`*`) selects all elements on the page.

14. **What is the difference between `>` and ` ` (space) in CSS selectors?**

    - **Solution:** The `>` selector selects direct children, while the ` ` (space) selector selects all descendants.

15. **What is the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class?**

    - **Solution:** The `:nth-child()` pseudo-class selects elements based on their position in a group of siblings.

16. **What is the `:hover` pseudo-class?**

    - **Solution:** The `:hover` pseudo-class applies styles to an element when the user hovers over it with the mouse.

17. **What is the `:focus` pseudo-class?**

    - **Solution:** The `:focus` pseudo-class applies styles to an element when it has focus, such as when a user clicks on an input field.

18. **What is the `:first-child` pseudo-class?**

    - **Solution:** The `:first-child` pseudo-class selects the first child element of its parent.

19. **What is the `:last-child` pseudo-class?**

    - **Solution:** The `:last-child` pseudo-class selects the last child element of its parent.

20. **What is the `:not()` pseudo-class?**
    - **Solution:** The `:not()` pseudo-class selects elements that do not match the given selector.

    - **Solution:** `position: relative` positions the element relative to its normal position, while `position: absolute` positions the element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.

33. **What is `position: fixed`?**

    - **Solution:** `position: fixed` positions the element relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.

34. **What is `position: sticky`?**

    - **Solution:** `position: sticky` is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed.

35. **How do you center an element with `position: absolute`?**

    - **Solution:** You can use `top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);`.

36. **What is the `z-index` property?**

    - **Solution:** The `z-index` property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with a higher `z-index` will be displayed in front of an element with a lower `z-index`.

37. **What is the `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left` property?**

    - **Solution:** These properties are used to position an element when its `position` is set to `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`.

38. **What is the `float` property?**

    - **Solution:** The `float` property is used to push an element to the left or right, allowing other elements to wrap around it.

39. **What is the `clear` property?**

82. **What is SASS?**

    - **Solution:** SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins to CSS.

83. **What are the benefits of using a CSS preprocessor?**

    - **Solution:** Benefits include:
      - ‚û°Ô∏è Increased code maintainability.
      - ‚û°Ô∏è Improved code organization through nesting and mixins.
      - ‚û°Ô∏è Use of variables for managing consistent styles.
      - ‚û°Ô∏è Ability to write more concise and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.

84. **What are variables in SASS?**

    - **Solution:** Variables in SASS allow you to store values (like colors or font sizes) that can be reused throughout your stylesheet. They start with a `$`. Example: `$primary-color: blue;`

85. **What are mixins in SASS?**

    - **Solution:** Mixins are reusable blocks of CSS code that you can include in your styles. They start with `@mixin`. Example: `@mixin rounded-corners($radius) { border-radius: $radius; }`

86. **What is nesting in SASS?**

    - **Solution:** Nesting allows you to nest CSS selectors within each other, making your code more organized and readable.

87. **What are extends in SASS?**

    - **Solution:** Extends allow you to share styles between selectors. One selector can inherit the styles of another selector. Uses `@extend`.

88. **What is the difference between mixins and extends in SASS?**

    - **Solution:** Mixins include the actual CSS code within the compiled output, while extends create more efficient CSS by grouping selectors that share the same styles. Mixins are generally more flexible.

89. **What is LESS?**

    - **Solution:** LESS (Leaner Style Sheets) is another CSS preprocessor similar to SASS.

90. **What are some other CSS preprocessors besides SASS and LESS?**

    - **Solution:** Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in a row or a column.

93. **What are CSS Custom Properties (Variables)?**

    - **Solution:** CSS Custom Properties (also known as CSS variables) are entities defined by web authors that contain values that can be reused throughout a stylesheet. They are defined using `--`. Example: `--primary-color: blue;`

94. **What is the `var()` function in CSS?**

    - **Solution:** The `var()` function is used to access the value of a CSS custom property. Example: `color: var(--primary-color);`

95. **What is the `calc()` function in CSS?**

    - **Solution:** The `calc()` function allows you to perform calculations within your CSS. Example: `width: calc(100% - 20px);`
